Solver Algorithm:

* Keep a list of which characters have been found to avoid
  checking results from those squares in the future
* Maybe keep a list of enums of colors to make stuff easier

* Pick the word at the top of the remaining list
* Make the keyboard type it into the game
* Scan the pixels and determine the color for each box
* Update list based on color of each box

I'm thinking I'll store the calibration data into a file and add an
option to skip calibration and use saved data instead.
