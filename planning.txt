Overall Process:

1) Startup
    * GUI asks to Start
    * Prompts to start calibration when ready
2) Calibration:
    * Ask user to click on top left and bottom right 
      corners of the 6x5 wordle grid
        * Need to press spacebar before and after to ignore 
          clicks used for navigation
    * Use that to obtain a rough idea of where each square is
    * Color calibration: just approximate?
3) Start running through guesses

* Screw this, I'm gonna focus on the actual bot backend first,
  then I'll worry about giving it a GUI and making it easy to use

* Should calibration be a part of the bot or the driver?
