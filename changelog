I decided to merge the calibration and solver into one
class. I'm also hvaing all print statments print to a 
stream so that I can have a driver class that can pass
in a stream object to both the Bot class and the GUI 
class. This way the two classes should be able to 
read and write from the same thing while avoiding
any global variables.
