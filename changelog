NVM, it was the GREY case that was causing issues. I thought
it was the easiest case, even though it ended up being the 
most complex case to handle. 

And things do seem to be working. The algorithm is not looking
and word popularity or anything, so it could probably be 
improved. For example, it took all 6 tries to get "FLUFF".
And it couldn't even get "CREED".
